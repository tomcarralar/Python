funny memes are distributed efficiently.

The application should analyze the social network, detect clusters of users (clumps) and, if necessary, propose new friendship connections to increase network connectivity.

## SVM with Common Structures

## SNM with Advanced Structures
- Improved efficiency, going from O(n^2) to O(nlogn) or lower
